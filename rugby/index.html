		<p>Rugby is one of my favorite sports, I play forward for Skyline rugby currently and I love it. Rugby is such a fun sport because it is so free flowing and there is such a great community arond the sport and it gives me so many connections. Skyline Rugby is the 18th ranked team in Utah and we will be competing for a State title this year and I'm super excited for it. I love my team and rugby has blessed my life so much.</p>
